# TLS
DON'T YOU EVER USE THIS FOR ANY PRODUCTION PROJECT. I DARE YOU!

Basic implementation of the TLS 1.2 in pure PHP, asynchronous on top of qcEvents. There are some dependencies to hash and openssl, but only to do the tough cryptographic work - the wire protocol is pure PHP.

This is at the moment server-only and has no abilities to push data forward to the application layer. It just establishes a TLS 1.2-secured connection and keeps saying 'PONG!' whenever it receives some data on the application layer.
